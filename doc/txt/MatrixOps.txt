== User documentation for MatrixOps ==
%======================================================================

``MatrixOps`` gathers together a number of operations on matrices; in
most cases these operations are happy to accept a ``MatrixView``
(see [[MatrixView]]) as argument.

When not specified, a matrix argument is of type ``ConstMatrixView``.

=== Matrix accessors ===

- ``M[i,j]`` read the ``(i,j)``-entry of matrix ``M``
- ``SetEntry(M,i,j, val)``  set the ``(i,j)``-entry of matrix ``M``
- ``GetRow(M,i)``  return the ``i``-th row of ``M`` as a ``vector<RingElem>``
- ``GetCol(M,j)``  return the ``j``-th col of ``M`` as a ``vector<RingElem>``
- ``GetRows(M)``  return the rows of ``M`` as a ``vector<vector<RingElem>>``
- ``GetCols(M)``  return the cols of ``M`` as a ``vector<vector<RingElem>>``
- ``FlattenByRows(M)``  return entries of ``M`` in a ``vector<RingElem>`` in order 1st row, 2nd row, etc
- ``FlattenByCols(M)``  return entries of ``M`` in a ``vector<RingElem>`` in order 1st col, 2nd col, etc

Note that ``GetRow``, ``GetCol``, ``GetRows``, ``GetCols``, ``FlattenByRows`` and ``FlattenByCols`` make copies of the matrix entries.


=== Matrix Arithmetic ===

There are two ways of multiplying two matrices together.  The infix
operators return a [[DenseMatrix]]; the procedural version may be
slightly faster than the infix operator.
- ``mul(matrix& lhs, M1, M2)`` -- a procedure equivalent to ``lhs = M1*M2;``, note that ``lhs`` might be a ``SparseMatrix`` **(not yet implemented)**
- ``operator*(M1, M2)``  -- the product ``M1*M2``
- ``operator+(M1, M2)``  -- the sum ``M1+M2``
- ``operator-(M1, M2)``  -- the difference ``M1-M2``
- ``power(M, n)``  compute ``n``-th power of ``M``; if ``n`` is negative then ``M`` must be invertible
- ``operator*(n, M1)``   -- scalar multiple of ``M1`` by ``n`` (integer or RingElem)
- ``operator*(M1, n)``   -- scalar multiple of ``M1`` by ``n`` (integer or RingElem)
- ``operator/(M1, n)``   -- scalar multiple of ``M1`` by ``1/n`` (where ``n`` is integer or RingElem)
- ``operator-(M1)``      -- scalar multiple of ``M1`` by -1


=== Matrix norms ===

Here are some matrix norms.  The result is an element of the ring
containing the matrix elements.  Note that ``FrobeniusNormSq`` gives the
**square** of the Frobenius norm (so that the value surely lies in the
same ring).
- ``FrobeniusNormSq(M)``  -- the **square** of the Frobenius norm
- ``OperatorNormInfinity(M)`` -- the infinity norm, ring must be ordered
- ``OperatorNorm1(M)`` -- the one norm, ring must be ordered


=== Sundry functions ===

Here are some fairly standard functions on matrices.
- ``det(M)``      -- determinant of ``M`` (M must be square)
- ``IsZeroDet(M)``  -- equivalent to ``IsZero(det(M))`` (but may be faster)
- ``HadamardBoundSq(M)`` -- computes row and column bounds in a ``struct`` (fields ``myRowBound`` and ``myColBound``)
- ``rk(M)``       -- rank of ``M`` (the base ring must be an integral domain)
- ``inverse(M)``  -- inverse of ``M`` as a [[DenseMatrix]]
- ``adj(M)``      -- classical adjoint of ``M`` as a [[DenseMatrix]]; sometimes called "adjugate".
- ``rref(M)`` -- compute a reduced row echelon form of ``M`` (orig. matrix is unchanged); matrix must be over a field
- ``PseudoInverse(M)`` -- PseudoInverse of ``M`` as a [[DenseMatrix]].
                   I suspect that it requires that the matrix be of full rank.
- ``LinSolve(M,rhs)``  -- solve for ``x`` the linear system ``M*x = rhs``; result is a [[DenseMatrix]]; if no soln exists, result is the 0-by-0 matrix
- ``LinKer(M)``  -- solve for ``x`` the linear system ``M*x = 0``; returns a [[DenseMatrix]] whose columns are a base for ``ker(M)``
- ``LinKerZZ(M)``  -- solve for ``x`` the linear system ``M*x = 0``; returns a [[DenseMatrix]] whose columns are a ZZ-base for integer points in ``ker(M)``


==== Further sundry functions ====

Here are some standard operations where the method used is specified explicitly.
It would usually be better to use the generic operations above, as those should
automatically select the most appropriate method for the given matrix.
- ``det2x2(M)``  -- only for 2x2 matrices
- ``det3x3(M)``  -- only for 3x3 matrices
- ``det4x4(M)``  -- only for 4x4 matrices
- ``det5x5(M)``  -- only for 5x5 matrices
- ``DetByGauss(M)`` -- matrix must be over an integral domain
- ``RankByGauss(std::vector<long>& IndepRows, M)``
- ``InverseByGauss(M)`` -- some restrictions (needs gcd)
- ``AdjointByDetOfMinors(M)``
- ``AdjointByInverse(M)`` --  base ring must be integral domain
- ``LinSolveByGauss(M,rhs)`` -- solve a linear system using gaussian elimination
                    (base ring must be a field), result is a [[DenseMatrix]]
- ``LinSolveByHNF(M,rhs)`` -- solve a linear system using Hermite NormalForm
                    (base ring must be a PID), result is a [[DenseMatrix]]
- ``LinSolveByModuleRepr(M,rhs)`` -- solve a linear system using module element representation, result is a [[DenseMatrix]]


- ``void GrammSchmidtRows(MatrixView& M)``  -- NYI
- ``void GrammSchmidtRows(MatrixView& M, long row)``  -- NYI


== Maintainer documentation for MatrixOps ==
%======================================================================

Most impls are quite straightforward.

``power`` is slightly clever with its iterative impl of binary powering.

``LinSolveByGauss`` is a little complicated because it tries to handle all
cases (//e.g.// full rank or not, square or more rows than cols or more cols than rows)


== Bugs, Shortcomings and other ideas ==
%======================================================================

Can we make a common "gaussian elimination" impl which is called by the
various algorithms needing it, rather than having several separate
implementations?

Is the procedure ``mul`` really any faster than the infix operator?

== Main changes ==
%======================================================================

**2012**

-

**2011**
- May: Added power fn for matrices: cannot yet handle negative powers.
- March: added multiplication by RingElem
