<H2>User documentation for using Janet bases</H2>

<P>
The files <CODE>JBDatastructure.H</CODE>, <CODE>JBSets.H</CODE>, <CODE>JBAlgorithm.H</CODE> and <CODE>JBMill.H</CODE> introduce several classes for computing and working with <B>Janet basis</B>.
The normal user should only use the classes <CODE>Involutive::JBMill</CODE> and <CODE>Involutive::JBMill::Builder</CODE> to interact with Janet bases.
</P>

<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H3>Computing a Janet basis</H3>

<P>
To compute a Janet basis the user should use the class <CODE>Involutive::JBMill::Builder</CODE>. To construct a <CODE>Involutive::JBMill::Builder</CODE> object the user has to use the standard constructor. For configuration of the building process there are several methods:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><CODE>setInput(v)</CODE> -- <CODE>v</CODE> must be a <CODE>vector&lt;RingElem&gt;</CODE>. It sets the generating set of the ideal to <CODE>v</CODE>.
<LI><CODE>setInput(cBegin, cEnd)</CODE> -- <CODE>cBegin</CODE> and <CODE>cEnd</CODE> must be a <CODE>vector&lt;RingElem&gt;::const_iterator</CODE> and must define a range of <CODE>RingElem</CODE>. The method sets the generating set of the ideal to this range.
<LI><CODE>setStrategy(strat)</CODE> -- <CODE>strat</CODE> must be a <CODE>Involutive::StrategyFlag</CODE>. Possible enums are <CODE>TQDegree</CODE>, <CODE>TQBlockHigh</CODE>, <CODE>TQBlockLow</CODE> and <CODE>GBCompletion</CODE>. It defines the algorithm which should be used to compute a Janet basis. If this method is never called the Builder object uses the <CODE>TQBlockLow</CODE> strategy.
<LI><CODE>setInvolutiveCriteria(crits)</CODE> -- <CODE>crits</CODE> must be a <CODE>bitset&lt;3&gt;</CODE>. Every bit represents one of the three involutive criteria. If this method is never called the Builder object uses the first two involutive criteria.
<P></P>
The methods are chainable, e.g. the user can do the following: <CODE>builder.setInput(input).setStrategy(Involutive::TQDegree)</CODE>. If the user calls a method more than one time only the input of the last method call is taken into account.
To construct a <CODE>JBMill</CODE> out of a correctly configured builder object <CODE>build</CODE> the user has to use <CODE>JBMill(build)</CODE>. If the user does not set a input the construction of a <CODE>JBMill</CODE> will fail.

<H3>Using the JBMill</H3>

<P>
In the following let <CODE>elem</CODE> be a <CODE>RingElem</CODE>.
</P>

<UL>

<H2>Maintainer documentation for JBDatastructure, JBSets, JBAlgorithm, JBMill</H2>

<P>
The basic datastructures to deal with Janet basis are implemented in <CODE>JBDatastructure.C</CODE>. Everything of the following lives in the namespace <CODE>CoCoA::Involutive</CODE>.
</P>

<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H3>JanetDatastructure</H3>

<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H4>JanetTriple</H4>

<P>
The <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE> is nothing else than a polynomial with some extra informations.
In addition to the polynomial <CODE>myPolynom</CODE> it has a data member <CODE>myAncestor</CODE> which is usually the LPP of <CODE>myPolynom</CODE> and the already prolonged variables (<CODE>myAlreadyProlongedVars</CODE>). If the <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE> arises from a prolongation <CODE>x_i * myP^\prime</CODE> the ancestor is the LPP of <CODE>myP^\prime</CODE>.
</P>

<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H4>JanetNodeBase, JanetLeafNodeImpl, JanetInternalNodeImpl, JanetHandle, JanetTree</H4>

<P>
The <CODE>JanetTree</CODE> is the basic data structure to compute and deal efficiently with a Janet basis.
It is a binary tree. A Janet tree contains the Janet basis in its leaf nodes.
Therefore we distinguish between internal nodes (<CODE>JanetInternalNodes</CODE>) and leaf nodes (<CODE>JanetLeafNodes</CODE>).
The tree is designed as a nested set of lists.
A node basically consists of the distance to the next variable (the distance to next node to the right) and the next degree (the distance to next node to the left).
An internal node contains a list of <CODE>JanetHandles</CODE> additionally, which represents the following tree to the right.
A leaf node contains, beside the distance information, a <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>.
The <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE> is not a direct data member of a leaf node.
It is stored in a list.
<CODE>JanetLeafNodeImpl</CODE> only gets an iterator from this list.
The <CODE>JanetHandle</CODE> handles the distinction between the <CODE>JanetLeafNodeImpl</CODE> and the <CODE>JanetInternalNodeImpl</CODE> because a stl-container cannot reasonable handle different classes even if they have the same base class.
</P>

<H5>Problems&amp;Ideals related to JanetNodeBase, JanetLeafNodeImpl, JanetInternalNodeImpl, JanetHandle, JanetTree</H5>

<P>
The <CODE>JanetTree</CODE> only works with a list of <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>'s. It would be useful if it would work with a list of polynomials as well.
</P>

<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H4>JanetContainer</H4>

<P>
The last part of the previous paragraph shows a strong connection between the list of <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE> which shall represents the Janet basis and the <CODE>JanetTree</CODE> which is another representation of the Janet basis.
This could lead to strange situations which has as a consequence invalidate iterators.
To avoid this during the normal usage of these two datastructure we introduce a <CODE>JanetContainer</CODE>.
<CODE>JanetContainer</CODE> couples these two datastructures.
It contains a list of <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>'s and a <CODE>JanetTree</CODE> which leaf nodes consists of iterators to this list.
With this coupling the user can deal with a Janet basis safely.
But for computing a Janet basis we do not use this class for efficiency reasons.
</P>

<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<H4>JanetIterator</H4>

<P>
The task of <CODE>JanetIterator</CODE> is to offer a way to navigate through the <CODE>JanetTree</CODE>.
Basically the <CODE>JanetIterator</CODE> consists of a pointer to the specific <CODE>JanetTree</CODE>, pointer to the current in the tree and an iterator to a specific position in this list.
The <CODE>JanetIterator</CODE> provides access (if possible) to the underlying <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>, provides the possibility to move forward in the tree, provides some informations of the current position in the tree and provides the functionality to add a new node in the <CODE>JanetTree</CODE> behind the current position.
For knowing the way from the beginning of the tree to the current position it consists of a vector of longs which stores the specific degrees and the current variable.
</P>

<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<H3>JBSets</H3>

<P>
The most important algorithm to compute Janet basis is the TQ-Algorithm.
There are two variants of it: the basic TQDegree strategy and the more advanced TQBlock strategy.
The TQDegree strategy deals with a set T and Q. In short, through the computation the algorithm moves elements mainly from Q to T and vica versa. To deal efficiently with it we introduced the class <CODE>TQSets</CODE>. It consists of the sets T (<CODE>mySetT</CODE>) and Q (<CODE>mySetQ</CODE>) which are ordered. Both are represented as <CODE>std::multiset</CODE>.
They contain <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE> and ordered by the LPP's of them (Because these LPP's are not unique during the computation we choosing <CODE>std::multiset</CODE>).
The <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>'s are not contained directly in the set T and Q itself, as it is very expensive to move them from one set to the other.
Therefore there is a third set (<CODE>myBasicSet</CODE>) which is implemented as list of <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>'s which contains the <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>'s itself.
The sets T and Q only contain an iterator to a specific position of these sets.
</P>
<P>
For applying the BlockTQ algorithm we need a third set P (<CODE>mySetP</CODE>) which is implemented like T and Q. Due to the similarity we introduced a subclass of <CODE>TQSets</CODE> which is called <CODE>TQPSets</CODE>. In addition to the new set P it introduces a strategy flag which influences the way how we move elements from Q to P.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the above mentioned sets <CODE>TQSets</CODE> consists of a <CODE>SparsePolyRing</CODE>, a <CODE>ReductionCog</CODE> and a <CODE>bitset&lt;3&gt;</CODE> (<CODE>myCriteria</CODE>). <CODE>myCriteria</CODE> regulates which involutive criteria shall be applied during the computation. Every bit stands for one single involutive criteria.
</P>

<H4>Problems&amp;Ideas related to JBSets</H4>

<P>
Again the construction of the sets T,Q and <CODE>myBasicSet</CODE> is dangerous. There could be invalid iterators in the set T and Q.
In addition to that it can happen (it really happens!!!!) that we can modify an element in <CODE>myBasicSet</CODE> in such a way that the ordering in T or Q would be change.
But T and Q does not realizing this change.
Therefore we getting again an invalid state.
A solution for the second problem could be to store T and Q simply as a list of iterators of <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>'s and sort the list manually every time we want to have a sorted list. Maybe this solution is even faster than the current one!
</P>

<H3>JBAlgorithm</H3>

<A NAME="toc14"></A>
<H4>JBAlgorithm</H4>

<P>
This class provides an interface for computing Janet bases.
It defines a method to compute a Janet basis for a given input, and a method to get a JanetContainer which should contain the computed Janet basis.
Also it contains as basic data the polynomial ring and the <CODE>PPMonoid</CODE>.
Every class which computes a Janet basis has to be a subclass of this class.
</P>

<A NAME="toc15"></A>
<H4>TQAlgorithm</H4>

<P>
This class is a subclass of <CODE>JBAlgorithm</CODE> but is again purely virtual.
It acts as an interface for all algorithms which using the TQ strategy.
In addition to the data members of the base class it defines amongst other things a <CODE>JanetTree</CODE> (<CODE>myJTree</CODE>).
All <CODE>TQAlgorithm</CODE> subclasses deal with the class <CODE>TQSets</CODE> or a subclass of it.
To get a unique access to the specific data member (which is defined in the subclasses) we implemented a purely virtual function <CODE>myGetSets</CODE> which returns a reference to the specific data members.
With this construction we are able to initialize the specific set in the class <CODE>TQAlgorithm</CODE> via the method <CODE>myInitialization</CODE>.
In addition to that <CODE>TQAlgorithm</CODE> contains a method to return the ideal which is generated by <CODE>1</CODE>.
</P>

<A NAME="toc16"></A>
<H4>DegreeTQ</H4>

<P>
This class is a subclass of <CODE>TQAlgorithm</CODE>. It defines the data member <CODE>mySets</CODE> (a <CODE>TQSets</CODE> instance) additionally. In addition to that it implements the purely virtual methods <CODE>myGetSets</CODE> and <CODE>myComputer</CODE>.
</P>

<A NAME="toc17"></A>
<H4>BlockTQ</H4>

<P>
This class is a subclass of <CODE>TQAlgorithm</CODE>. It defines the data member <CODE>mySets</CODE> (a <CODE>TQPSets</CODE> instance) additionally. In addition to that it implements the purely virtual methods <CODE>myGetSets</CODE> and <CODE>myComputer</CODE>.
</P>

<A NAME="toc18"></A>
<H4>CompletionGB</H4>

<P>
This class defines another approach to compute Janet basis, than the TQ approach.
Here we first compute a reduced Groebner basis and complete it to the minimal Janet basis. It is a subclass of <CODE>JBAlgorithm</CODE>. The class implements the purely virtual methods <CODE>myComputer</CODE> and <CODE>myOutputResult</CODE> and defines a <CODE>JanetTree</CODE> and a list of <CODE>JanetTriple</CODE>'s as data members. In addition to that it implements several methods to compute the completion.
</P>

<A NAME="toc19"></A>
<H3>JBMill</H3>

<A NAME="toc20"></A>
<H4>JBMill</H4>

<P>
This class defines the representation of a Janet basis accessible by the user.
As data members it contains a <CODE>JanetContainer</CODE> (<CODE>myBasis</CODE>), a <CODE>SparsePolyRing</CODE> (<CODE>myPolyRing</CODE>) and a <CODE>PPMonoid</CODE> (<CODE>myPPMValue</CODE>).
The class defines several methods to work with the Janet basis. For example the user can compute the multiplicative variables, the Groebner basis or some invariants like the hilbert polynomial.
In addition to that it acts as a base class for the <CODE>PBMill</CODE>, which is the representation of a Pommaret basis.
</P>

<H5>Problems&amp;Ideas related to JBMill</H5>

<P>
Maybe introduce typedefs or structs for complicated objects like a complementary decomposition.
Add several methods to check different stability position.
</P>

<A NAME="toc21"></A>
<H4>JBMill::Builder</H4>

<P>
This class is designed to construct a Janet basis.
The goal of this class is to separate the construction of the <CODE>JBMill</CODE> from its representation.
The 'Gang of Four' (Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides - Design Patterns) served
as template for the construction.
The corresponding pattern is called <B>Building Pattern</B>.
To construct a <CODE>JBMill</CODE> out of the builder object the user can call a constructor of <CODE>JBMill</CODE> with a configured builder object.
