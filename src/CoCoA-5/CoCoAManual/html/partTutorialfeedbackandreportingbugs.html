We try to make CoCoA natural and easy to use, and have everything
properly described in the manual.  However, there is always room
for improvement, and we are happy to receive constructive criticism.
<br><br>
We try hard to make CoCoA reliable, but some bugs surely slip through
our testing.
So if you find an example where CoCoA goes wrong, let us know.
If you can, try to find a "small" example which triggers the problem.
Send us all the commands we must execute to reproduce the bug, and the
correct output you expected.
Please, also tell us which version of CoCoA you are using
(see <A HREF="cmdVersionInfo.html">
    <tt>VersionInfo</tt>
  </A>), and which operating system your
computer uses (i.e. Linux, Mac or Microsoft Windows).
<br><br>
To give feedback or report a bug send email to the address
<tt><b style="background:#bbeeee">cocoa@dima.unige.it</b></tt> and we will reply soon.
We also usually put information about bugs and new features into the
"redmine" issue-tracking system, at <tt><b style="background:#bbeeee">https://cocoa.dima.unige.it/redmine/</b></tt>.
