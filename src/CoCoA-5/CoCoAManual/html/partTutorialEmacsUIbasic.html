The developers of CoCoA use the (GNU) emacs UI to CoCoA-5, so it is
extensively tested.  Other UIs may become available in the future.
<br><br>
Emacs is an extensible text editor with numerous functions.  One of these
extensions helps one edit files of CoCoA commands, and also run an
interactive CoCoA-5 session.  Many of the special functions for CoCoA-5
are available from a "drop-down" menu (under the title CoCoA-5).
<br><br>
We find the following approach convenient.  Inside Emacs use the
"Open File" function to open (or create) a file whose name <b>must</b> end
in ".cocoa5".  Type in your commands and function definitions into this
file; then use "Source file into CoCoA-5" or "Source region into CoCoA-5".
An advantage of this approach is that if you make a mistake, you can
easily edit the file, and then send the corrected commands to CoCoA-5.
<br><br>
The functions can also be activated via suitable key-sequences; this is
usually quicker than using the menus, but entails memorizing the most
useful "key sequences".  A key sequence usually looks cryptic:
for example in the key sequence "C-M-\", the substring "M-" means to
press and release the "Esc" key, while the substring "C-" means to
press and hold the "Ctrl" key, finally you should press briefly the
"\" (backslash) key.
