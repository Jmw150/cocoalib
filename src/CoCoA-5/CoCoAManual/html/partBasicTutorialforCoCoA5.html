Use the command <tt><b style="background:#bbeeee">ciao;</b></tt> to get out of CoCoA-5.  It is important to type
the semicolon ";" after the word "ciao".  As a rule, you should put a
semicolon after every CoCoA-5 command.  After receiving the <tt><b style="background:#bbeeee">ciao</b></tt>
command, it may occasionally take a few seconds for CoCoA-5 to fully
terminate itself.
<br><br>
If CoCoA-5 is busy computing, it will not heed any further commands
(including <tt><b style="background:#bbeeee">ciao;</b></tt>) until the computation ends.  When CoCoA-5 is
ready for a new command it prints out a prompt; if the previous input
was incomplete, this is indicated by a different prompt.
<br><br>
If CoCoA-5 is taking too long with a computation you may "interrupt" it
(i.e. forcibly end it prematurely); it may take a few seconds for
CoCoA-5 to react after you give the interrupt signal.  CoCoA-5 will print
a prompt when the computation has been stopped; it is then ready to
receive new commands.  The correct way to interrupt a CoCoA computation
depends on the user interface (and operating system).
<br><br>
If you are still stuck inside CoCoA-5, you can try <tt><b style="background:#bbeeee">*/ciao;</b></tt> instead;
note the extra two characters "star" and "slash" at the start.  You may
need to type this twice.
