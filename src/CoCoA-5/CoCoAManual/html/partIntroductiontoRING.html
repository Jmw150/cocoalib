Rings, and especially polynomial rings, play a central role in CoCoA.
<br><br>
The user can define many rings, but at any time a single <b>current ring</b>
is active within the system.
<br><br>
Once a ring has been defined, the system can handle the following
mathematical objects defined over that ring:

  <pre>
 * elements of the ring
 * ideals
 * matrices
 * lists of objects
 * modules (submodules of a free module)
 * rings
</pre>

Variables containing ring-dependent objects such as polynomials,
ideals, and matrices are <b>labeled</b> by their ring.
Any operation on them is performed in their ring, independently of
what the current ring is.
